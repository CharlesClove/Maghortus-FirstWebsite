I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a cool website for buying gardening stuff online.

Works on computers, tablets, and phones.
You can click around easily to find what you need.
It has cool interactive stuff thanks to JavaScript.
The design is all about nature and gardening vibes.

Note:
I made this website to learn and improve. It might not be perfect.
